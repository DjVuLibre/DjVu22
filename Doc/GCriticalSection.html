<BLOCKQUOTE>Mutual exclusion class.  Class <TT>GCriticalSection</TT> provides an efficient
way to protect segment of codes (<EM>critical sections</EM>) which should
not be simultaneously executed by two threads. Only one thread can own a
critical section object at a given time.  Function <!1><A HREF="GCriticalSection.html#DOC.1.4.7.2.1">lock</A> causes the
current thread to own the critical section object (or wait as long as
necessary). Function <!1><A HREF="GCriticalSection.html#DOC.1.4.7.2.2">unlock</A> is used to release the critical section
object.  Critical section in the code are easily protected by creating a
critical section object, locking this object at beginning of the critical
section code, and unlocking the object at the end of the critical section
code. Class <!1><A HREF="GCriticalSectionLock.html">GCriticalSectionLock</A> provides a convenient way to do
this effectively.<P><B>Note</B>. Both the copy constructor and the copy operator are declared
as private members. It is therefore not possible to make multiple copies of
instances of this class, as implied by the class semantic. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<A NAME="lock">
<A NAME="DOC.1.4.7.2.1">
<DT><IMG ALT="o" BORDER=0 SRC=icon2.gif><TT><B>void lock()</B></TT>
<DD>Locks a critical section. Only one thread can own a critical section at
a given time. If the critical section is already owned by another
thread, the thread waits until the critical section is released.
Otherwise the locking counter is incremented and the current thread is
given ownership of the critical section object.

<A NAME="unlock">
<A NAME="DOC.1.4.7.2.2">
<DT><IMG ALT="o" BORDER=0 SRC=icon2.gif><TT><B>void unlock()</B></TT>
<DD>Unlocks a critical section object. If the critical section is owned by
the current thread, the locking counter is decremented. The critical
section is released when the counter reaches zero.
