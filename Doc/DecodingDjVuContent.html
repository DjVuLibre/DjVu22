<BLOCKQUOTE>
Class <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html">DjVuImage</A> provides a simple interface for processing DjVu
content.  The complete documentation is found in section
<!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.h.html">DjVuImage.h</A>.  You may also consult the source code of program
<!1><A HREF="djvutopnm.html">djvutopnm</A>.<P>The DjVu Reference Library uses a two stage decoding model. 
<UL>
<LI> The first stage, called <EM>decoding</EM>, consists of analyzing a DjVu
or IW44 file and constructing a partially decoded representation of
the image in memory.  This partially decoded representation requires
much less memory (typically 1-2 MBytes) than the raw image
(typically 20-30 MBytes).  
<LI> The second stage, called <EM>rendering</EM>, consists of using this
representation to recreate the pixels for any part of the image at
any resolution.  You should render <EM>on-the-fly</EM> the part of the
image that you actually wish to display.  This strategy minimizes
both the memory and the computational requirements.
</UL><P>
The sample decoding code below may be called once when you receive the
DjVu data.  The function <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.18.5.4.1">decode</A> processes the data stream 
represented by class <!1><A HREF="ByteStream.html">ByteStream</A> and updates the <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html">DjVuImage</A> object.
<PRE>
       DjVuImage img;
       ByteStream &amp;bs = my_incoming_data_stream();
       img.decode(bs);
    </PRE>
The sample rendering code below may be called whenever you need to
redisplay part of a window showing DjVu image.  Class <!1><A HREF="GRect.html">GRect</A> is used
to represent two rectangles of interest. Rectangle <TT>full</TT> represents the
range of pixels that would be occupied by the full DjVu image. This
rectangle may be much larger than your computer screen.  The ratio between
the size of this rectangle and the size of the image implicitly defines
the resolution of the displayed image.  Rectangle <TT>part</TT> represents the
range of pixel that you actually want to compute.  This rectangle always
corresponds to a visible portion of your screen.  The functions
<!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.18.5.6.1">get_pixmap</A> and <!1><A HREF="DjVuImage.html#DOC.1.4.18.5.6.2">get_bitmap</A> return a
"smart" <!1><A HREF="GP.html">GP</A> pointer to either a <!1><A HREF="GPixmap.html">GPixmap</A> or <!1><A HREF="GBitmap.html">GBitmap</A>
containing the requested pixels.
<PRE>
       GRect part = my_rectangle_to_redisplay();
       GRect full = my_rectangle_for_the_full_image();
       // Try rendering in color
       GP&lt;GPixmap&gt; pm = img-&gt;get_pixmap(part, full);
       if (pm) { my_display_in_color(pm); return; }
       // Try rendering in gray
       GP&lt;GBitmap&gt; bm = img-&gt;get_bitmap(part, full);
       if (bm) { my_display_in_grays(bm); return ; }
    </PRE><P>Progressive display can be implemented using multi-threading.  The browser
starts a decoding thread as soon as it starts receiving data.  The
decoding progress can be monitored using class <!1><A HREF="DjVuInterface.html">DjVuInterface</A>. The
main thread can call the rendering functions at any time while the
decoding is in progress.  These function render the image as early as
possible, using only the already decoded data.<P>Section <!1><A HREF="GThreads.h.html">GThreads.h</A> discusses the multi-threading capabilities of the
DjVu Reference Library.  These features must be enabled at compile-time
using the adequate option of the configuration script.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
