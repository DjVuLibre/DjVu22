<P><B>Description</B>

<P>This program assembles the DjVu file <TT>djvufile</TT> using the JB2 data
contained in file <TT>maskfile</TT> and the IW44 data contained in files <TT>bgfile</TT>
and <TT>fgfile</TT>.  Although this is slightly beyond the scope of the DjVu
Reference Library, the following description explains how to prepare the
input files required for assembling DjVu files.

<P><B>Recipe for creating a Photo DjVu File</B>

<P>You should first use program <!1><A HREF="c44.html">c44</A> and produce an IW44 file "my.iw4".
Assuming that this image is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high, you can
assemble file <TT>&quot;my.djvu&quot;</TT> using <TT>djvumake</TT> with the following arguments.
<PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;djvumake&nbsp;my.djvu&nbsp;&nbsp;INFO=640,480&nbsp;&nbsp;BG44=my.iw4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>
<B>Recipe for creating a Bilevel DjVu File</B>

<P>The first step consists in creating a <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html">JB2Image</A> object according to
the guidelines specified in section <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.h.html">JB2Image.h</A>.  Then use function
JB2Image::encode in class <!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html">JB2Image</A> to save the JB2 data into a
file named <TT>&quot;myjb2.q&quot;</TT> for instance.  You can then assemble file
<TT>&quot;my.djvu&quot;</TT> using <TT>djvumake</TT> with the following arguments:

<P><PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;djvumake&nbsp;my.djvu&nbsp;Sjbz=myjb2.q
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>

<P>
<B>Recipe for creating a Compound DjVu File</B>

<P>Let us assume that you use a program like Gimp <A HREF=http://www.gimp.org>http://www.gimp.org</A>
or Photoshop.  You have created your image using two layers.  The
background layer contains all pictures and background details.  The
foreground layer contains the text and the drawings. Transparency is
controlled by a layer mask attached to the foreground layer.  The layer
mask contains the shape of the text and drawings in black and white.  The
actual foreground layer contains large patches of color which are only
displayed where the layer mask is black.  You can see a Gimp example in
file <TT>&quot;@Samples/layers.xcf.gz&quot;</TT>.

<P>This layered model is very close to the Compound DjVu Image model.  In the
DjVu model however, the three images (the background layer, the foreground
layer mask, and the actual foreground layer) can have different
resolutions.
<UL>
<LI>
The size of the foreground layer mask is always equal to the size of the
DjVu image.  You must create a JB2 file containing the foreground mask as
explained in the <EM>Recipe for Creating a Bilevel DjVu File</EM>. Each zero
pixel in the mask means that the corresponding pixel in the raw image
belongs to the background. Each non zero pixel means that the
corresponding pixel in the raw image belongs to the foreground. Let us
call this file <TT>&quot;myjb2.q&quot;</TT>.
<LI>
The size of the background image is computed by rounding up the ratio
between the size of the mask and an integer background sub-sampling ratio
in range 1 to 12.  Choosing a sub-sampling ratio of 3 is usually a good
starting point.  You must then subsample the background layer image and save
it into a PPM file named <TT>&quot;mybg.ppm&quot;</TT>.  
<LI>
The size of the foreground color image is computed by rounding up the
ratio between the size of the mask and an integer background sub-sampling
ratio in range 1 to 12.  Choosing a sub-sampling ratio of 12 is usually
adequate.  You must then subsample the background layer image and save
it into a PPM file named <TT>&quot;myfg.ppm&quot;</TT>.  
</UL>

<P>When you subsample these images, you should consider some refinements.
The color of each pixel of the subsampled image is an average of the
colors of a couple of pixels in the original image.  When you compute this
average, you eliminate the original pixels which are not visible, such as
pixels of the background layer which are masked by the foreground, or
pixels of the foreground color layer which are not visible because of the
mask transparency.

<P>It sometimes happens that you cannot compute the color of a pixel in the
subsampled image because none of the pixels in the corresponding image are
visible.  That means that we do not really care about the color of the
subsampled pixel because it is not visible at all.  It is not desirable of
course to encode the color value of such pixels.  This is possible using
the <EM>masking</EM> feature of the wavelet encoder.  You must first save two
PBM images named <TT>&quot;mybg.pbm&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;myfg.pbm&quot;</TT>.  These images have the
same size as the corresponding PPM images.  A black pixel in these images
mean that we should not code the color of the corresponding pixel in the
PPM image.

<P>We must then encode both images using the <!1><A HREF="c44.html">c44</A> wavelet encoder.
The following commands to the trick:
<PRE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;c44&nbsp;-slice&nbsp;74+10+9+4&nbsp;-mask&nbsp;mybg.msk&nbsp;mybg.ppm&nbsp;mybg.iw4&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;c44&nbsp;-slice&nbsp;100&nbsp;-crcbfull&nbsp;-mask&nbsp;myfg.msk&nbsp;myfg.ppm&nbsp;myfg.iw4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</PRE>
Note that we use different options. The background wavelet file
<TT>&quot;mybg.iw4&quot;</TT> contains four refinement chunks specified by option <TT>-slice</TT>.
The foreground wavelet file <TT>&quot;myfg.iw4&quot;</TT> contains a single chunk (option
<TT>-slice</TT>) and allocated more bits for encoding the colors (option
<TT>-crcbfull</TT>). 

<P>The last step consists of assembling the DjVu file using <TT>djvumake</TT>.
