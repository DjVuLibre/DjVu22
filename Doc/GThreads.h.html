<BLOCKQUOTE>
Files <TT>&quot;GThreads.h&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;GThreads.cpp&quot;</TT> implement common entry points
for multithreading on multiple platforms.  Each execution thread is
represented by an instance of class <!1><A HREF="GThread.html">GThread</A>.  Portions of code can
be protected using class <!1><A HREF="GCriticalSection.html">GCriticalSection</A> or class
<!1><A HREF="GCriticalSectionLock.html">GCriticalSectionLock</A>. Synchronization is provided by class
<!1><A HREF="GEvent.html">GEvent</A>.<P>The value of compiler symbol <TT>THREADMODEL</TT> selects an appropriate
implementation for these classes. The current implementation supports
the following values:
<DL>
<DT><B>-DTHREADMODEL=NOTHREADS</B><DD> Dummy implementation.  This is a
good choice when the multithreading features are not required,
because it minimizes the portability problems.  This is currently
the default when compiling under Unix.
<DT><B>-DTHREADMODEL=WINTHREADS</B><DD> Windows implementation.
This is the default when compiling under Windows.
<DT><B>-DTHREADMODEL=MACTHREADS</B><DD> Macintosh implementation,
which is based on the MacOS cooperative model. The current 
implementation does not yet fully support synchronization.
This is the default when compiling under MacOS.
<DT><B>-DTHREADMODEL=POSIXTHREADS</B><DD> Posix implementation.
This implementation also supports DCE threads. The behavior of
the code is subject to the quality of the system implementation of
Posix threads.
<DT><B>-DTHREADMODEL=COTHREADS</B><DD> Custom cooperative threads.
These custom threads do not redefine system calls. Before executing
a potentially blocking system function, each thread must explicitly
check whether it is going to block and yield control explicitly if
this is the case.  This code must be compiled with a patched version
of egcs-1.1.1 <A HREF=http://egcs.cygnus.com>http://egcs.cygnus.com</A>. The patch addresses
exception thread-safety and is provided in <TT>&quot;@Tools/libgcc2.c.diff&quot;</TT>.
Once you get the right compiler, this implementation is remarkably
compact and portable. A variety of processors are supported,
including mips, intel, sparc, hppa, and alpha.
<DT><B>-DTHREADMODEL=JRITHREADS</B><DD> Java implementation hooks.
Multi-threading within a Netscape plugin can be tricky.  A simple
idea however consists of implementing the threading primitives in
Java and to access them using JRI.  The classes just contain a
JRIGlobalRef.  This is not a real implementation since everything
(Java code, native functions, stubs, exception thread safety) must
be addressed by the plugin source code. Performance may be an issue.
</DL><P><B>Portability</B>: The simultaneous use of threads and exceptions caused a
lot of portability headaches under Unix.  We eventually decided to
implement the COTHREADS cooperative threads (because preemptive threads
have more problems) and to patch EGCS in order to make exception handling
COTHREAD-safe.  We expect to make COTHREADs the default in future
releases.<P><B>ToDo</B>: For historical reasons, the interface is modeled after the
Win32 model.  This is unfortunate because more and more systems adopt the
simpler monitor approach.  It would be nice to change that some day.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
