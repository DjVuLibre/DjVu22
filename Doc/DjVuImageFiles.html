<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Photo DjVu Image</B> --- Photo DjVu Image files are best used for
encoding photographic images in colors or in shades of gray.  The data
compression model relies on the IW44 wavelet representation.  This format
is designed such that the IW44 decoder is able to quickly perform
progressive rendering of any image segment using only a small amount of
memory.<P>Photo DjVu files are composed of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite chunk.
This composite chunk always begins with one <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk describing the
image size and resolution (see <!1><A HREF="DjVuInfo.html">DjVuInfo</A>).  One or more additional
<TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> chunks contains the image data encoded with the IW44
representation (see IWPixmap or <!1><A HREF="IWBitmap.html">IWBitmap</A>).  The image size
specified in the <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk and the image size specified in the IW44
data must be equal.<P><B>Bilevel DjVu Image</B> --- Bilevel DjVu Image files are used to compress
black and white images representing text and simple drawings.  Heavily
dithered bilevel images are best encoded using Compound DjVu Images.  The
JB2 data compression model uses the soft pattern matching technique, which
essentially consists of encoding each character by describing how it
differs from a well chosen already encoded character.<P>Bilevel DjVu Files are composed of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite chunk.
This composite chunk always begins with one <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk describing the
image size and resolution (see <!1><A HREF="DjVuInfo.html">DjVuInfo</A>).  An additional <TT>&quot;Sjbz&quot;</TT>
chunk contains the bilevel data encoded with the JB2 representation (see
<!1><A HREF="JB2Image.html">JB2Image</A>).  The image size specified in the <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk and the
image size specified in the JB2 data must be equal.<P><B>Compound DjVu Image</B> --- Compound DjVu Files are an extremely
efficient way to compress high resolution Compound document images
containing both pictures and text, such as a page of a magazine.  Compound
DjVu Files represent the document images using two layers.  The <EM>
background layer</EM> is used for encoding the pictures and the paper texture.
The <EM>foreground layer</EM> is used for encoding the text and the drawings.<P>Compound DjVu Files are composed of a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVU&quot;</TT> composite
chunk.  This composite chunk always begins with one <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk
describing the size and the resolution of the image (see <!1><A HREF="DjVuInfo.html">DjVuInfo</A>).<P>The main component of the foreground layer is a bilevel image named the
<EM>foreground mask</EM>. The pixel size of the foreground mask is equal to
the size of the DjVu image.  It contains a black-on-white representation
of the text and the drawings.  This image is encoded in a single <TT>&quot;Sjbz&quot;</TT>
chunk using the JB2 representation.<P>The foreground layer also contains a small color image, the <EM>
foreground color image</EM>, encoded as a single <TT>&quot;FG44&quot;</TT> chunk using the IW44
representation (see IWPixmap or <!1><A HREF="IWBitmap.html">IWBitmap</A>).  Compound DjVu
images are rendered by painting the foreground color image on top of the
background color image using the foreground mask as a stencil.  The pixel
size of the foreground color image is computed by rounding up the quotient
of the mask size by an integer sub-sampling factor ranging from 1 to 12.
Most Compound DjVu Images use a foreground color sub-sampling factor equal
to 12.  Smaller sub-sampling factors produce very slightly better images.<P>The background layer is a color image encoded by an arbitrary number of
<TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> chunks containing successive IW44 refinements (see IWPixmap
or <!1><A HREF="IWBitmap.html">IWBitmap</A>).  The size of this image is computed by rounding up the
quotient of the mask size by an integer sub-sampling factor ranging from 1
to 12.  Most Compound DjVu Images use a background sub-sampling factor
equal to 3.  Smaller sub-sampling factors are adequate for images with a
very rich paper texture.  Larger sub-sampling factors are adequate for
images containing no pictures.<P>There are no ordering or interleaving constraints on these chunks except
that (a) the <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk must appear first, and (b) the successive
<TT>&quot;BG44&quot;</TT> refinements must appear with their natural order.  The chunk
order simply affects the progressive rendering of DjVu images on a web
browser.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
