The DjVu format already delivers extremely high compression ratios.  Yet
we keep evaluating new ideas and experimenting with new features.  Here is
a brief description of the various enhancements under evaluation.  We
intend to update the DjVu Reference Library as soon as we are satisfied
with such enhancements.<P><B>Hyper-links</B> --- We are considering an <EM>annotation chunk</EM>
containing directives for the DjVu image browser, such as hyper-links,
image placement, border color or default zoom factor.  Such directives
will be described using an extensible text syntax and stored into an
<TT>&quot;ANTa&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;ANTz&quot;</TT> chunk.<P><B>Included Files</B> --- Multiple DjVu files may share information such as
background layer or character shapes.  There are many benefits associated
with storing such shared information in separate files.  A well designed
browser may keep pre-decoded copies of these files in a cache.  This
procedure would reduce the size of the data transferred over the Internet
and also increase the display speed.  The currently envisioned scheme
involves an <EM>inclusion chunk</EM> (chunk identifier <TT>&quot;INCL&quot;</TT>) containing
the URL of a file to include.  The included file would be a <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVI&quot;</TT>
chunk potentially containing any information otherwise allowed in a DjVu
file (except for the <TT>&quot;INFO&quot;</TT> chunk of course).  The challenge consists in
making this system fast enough to hide the cost of an extra round-trip
between the browser and the web server.<P><B>Document Navigation</B> --- Documents can be represented using one DjVu
file per page. Each DjVu file may contain (or better: may include a file
containing) a <EM>navigation directory chunk</EM> (chunk identifier
<TT>&quot;NDIR&quot;</TT>). This navigation directory simply lists the URLs of all DjVu
files composing a document.  Once the DjVu browser knows the document
structure, it can use smart caching, pre-fetching and pre-decoding
strategies.<P><B>Multi-page Files</B> --- The next step consists in packaging all files in
a document (i.e. all the pages and all the included files) as a single
archive file.  Although this is good for archiving or emailing, using a
single file is not very good for web applications because it does not
provide a random access to each page.  Web designers would have the choice
of either (a) unpacking the archive, or (b) use an appropriate Apache
module or CGI script for unpacking the requested file on the fly.  The
preferred archive format is a single <TT>&quot;FORM:DJVM&quot;</TT> chunk containing a
directory (chunk identifier <TT>&quot;DIR0&quot;</TT>) and all the archived files with
their natural IFF structure.<P><B>Per-Character Color</B> --- Compound DjVu files represent the colors of
the text and drawings using a low resolution color image named the
foreground color image.  We are considering an alternative representation
using one color for each character (or more specifically, for each mask
component).  This alternative representation would be more appropriate for
encoding electronically produced documents.<P><B>Semantic Markups</B> --- DjVu files already contain a lot of information
about the structure of the page.  We could create a real <EM>multi-valued
document</EM> by adding a <TT>&quot;DXML&quot;</TT> chunk containing the textual information in
the page with adequate semantic markups.  The association between the
textual information and the image would be described by a <TT>&quot;DX2I&quot;</TT> chunk.
That would allow us to do Copy/Paste with DjVu documents.  </BLOCKQUOTE>
