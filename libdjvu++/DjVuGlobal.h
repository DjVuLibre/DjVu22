    This file is included by all include files in the DjVu reference library.
    It does nothing unless compilation symbols #NEED_DJVU_MEMORY#,
    #NEED_DJVU_PROGRESS# or #NEED_DJVU_NAMES# are defined.  These compilation
    symbols enable features which are useful for certain applications of the
    DjVu Reference Library.  These features are still experimental and
    therefore poorly documented.
